This is a javascript library which aims to help improve a project's documentation.  

If your library has plugins, using mentDoc.js, you can allow third-party people to augment your documentation with the docs of their own plugin.
Essentially making the lifes of your library users easier, since all the documentation would be in one place.  

This library is still in alpha
